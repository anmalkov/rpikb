# Installing Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi 4 or 3
To start working with your small Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+/4B you have to first install an operation system to it. There are a lot of operation systems available for Raspberry Pi. The recommended one is Raspberry Pi OS that is available in three options: 
* Lite [0.4 GB] - only command line interface (headless)
* Desktop [1.1 GB] - includes everything from Lite and adds user-friendly UI interface
* Full [2.5 GB] - includes everything from Desktop and adds recommended applications

However if you want to get as much as possible from your small Pi you can use Ubuntu 64-bit Server operation system [0.6 GB] that has command line interface only. It will allow us to install all that we need in the future and because it is a 64-bit OS, we will not have any problem to find the needed docker images.
